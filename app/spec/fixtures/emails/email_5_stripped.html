this guys, we had three other customers login this morning and it seems that
their accounts are also listed as: "Sync not running" but some of their
messages have been synced. Emails are below:<br><br><a href="mailto:drew@a.com">drew@a.com</a> (which is somehow
listed twice)<br><a href="mailto:s.k@g.com">s.k@g.com</a><br><a href="mailto:oprokhorenko@splunk.com">oprokhorenko@splunk.com</a></div><div><br></div><div>-Andrew</div><div>&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc

folks,<br><div><br>I made a new thread because the old one was getting really
long. We've noticed a few things when onboarding our first few Exchange
customers:<br><br></div><div>1. One of our users signed in to Nylas
successfully with email <a href="mailto:oprokhorenko@splunk.com" target="_blank">oprokhorenko@splunk.com</a>, but I see in the dashboard that
his status is "Sync not running", with a white circle rather than red or green.
We haven't seen this one before. Clicking on his entry does show 84 messages
synced, but that hasn't changed in a while. What should we
do?<br><br></div><div>2. We may be experiencing event duplication issues again,
but I'm still looking into this to see if we're causing the problem from our
side. The affected account in this case is <a href="mailto:han@a.com" target="_blank">han@a.com</a>. I'll send an update once I have
something concrete, but I wanted to bring it up in case there are any quick
checks you can run on his account in the
meantime.<br></div><div><br></div><div>3. I noticed that drafts have started
appearing in my delta sync. Maybe it was always this way and I didn't notice
because my testing accounts didn't have a user actively emailing, but we're
getting a lot of data that we don't need. We use exclude_types in our delta
sync requests, with every type except "event", but if I add "draft" to this
list, I get a bad request error from Nylas. Can you enable filtering of drafts
here?<br><br></div><div>Thanks again, and see you on Wednesday!<span><font color="#888888"><br></font></span></div><span><font color="#888888"><div>Jeff<br></div></font></span></div>
